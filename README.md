# Personal-LoRa-Module
A small compact module made to transmit and receive messages using sub gigahertzs frequencies of radio waves, for use in things such as automation, transmission, reception etc.

My LoRa module uses Sub GHz frequencies to tranceive radio waves. It uses the following components:
1. SX1262IMLTRT for transmission and reception.
2. RP2040 for Programing it for various applications.
3. 0900FM15D0039E as an RF filter.
4. AP2112K-3.3 as my LDO.
5. PE4259 as my RF switch.
6. Two quartz timer crystals (12 MHz and 32 MHz).
7. SMD Resistors.
8. SMD Capacitors.
9. SMD Inductors.
10. USB-C Receptacle.
